# MSP430_serial_comm_projects
Good playing around projects with TI's MSP430 to start up understanding the ideology behind UART, I2C and SPI communication
1. Using the ADC on a microcontroller to accumulate date for analyzibg sampling rates and then  visualizing it on MATLAB.
2. Hooking up an LCD with MSP430 and scrolling data using an external push button
3. Make one MSP430 communicate with another over UART communication and display the communication results on an LCD.
